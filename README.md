# govcy-unified-design-system

This is repository for the developer assets of the Unified Design System for gov.cy. If you are looking for information on using the Design System in an online service or a website, you should first check the ==gov.cy Unified Design System Documentation==
    
## Installation

`govcy-design-system` uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage it's dependencies. Therefore [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is a requirement of installing the design system.

You can find information about installing NPM [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

We use `npm>=10.x` to make use of the `package.json::overrides` functionality.

```
git clone https://github.com/gov-cy/govcy-design-system.git
cd govcy-design-system
npm install
```

## Usage
The project uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) to compile the sass files into css and [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to compile the javascript files.

We also use [express](https://expressjs.com/) to serve the pages build on [EJS](https://ejs.co).

### Developer Assets

All the assets (CSS, JS, images) that any implementation team will need to build a website or an online service using the UDS, are in the `dist/` directory.

### Contributing/ Updating/ Using

To make changes in the UDS developers should only need to make code changes to the files in the `src/` directory. Updating these files then running the build commands to update the files in `dist/` or `build/` will give you `.css` and `.js` files that you can use in a web page.

### Directory Structure
This is the directory structure of the design system.

- `.github`: Github actions
- `dev`: Development files (SASS and JS)
- `dist`: Distribution files with minified versions of the developer assets (CSS, JS) and images 
- `public`: Contains the assets used by express to serve the pages with un-minified versions of the developer assets (CSS, JS)
- `routes`: Routes for the express server
- `test`: Test scripts
- `views`: EJS templates

### Scripts and Commands

Listed below are is a list of the commands you can use to start the server and build the code.

#### Start server
To view changes live you can run the `npm start` command and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It will serve the the EJS views, based on the defined routes including the assets in the `public` folder.

#### Build

##### `npm run pre-build`

This will prepare the files to include the necessary comments (for example version number)

##### `npm run build-all`

This will run build the SASS and JS files into minified versions in the `dist` directory.

##### `npm run build`

This will run build the SASS and JS files into un-minified versions in the `public` directory.

### Visual Regression Tests

The project uses [Percy](https://percy.io/) to make visual regression tests on pages dedicated to regression testing. To do this we use [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) to run the tests in headless mode. 

The tests are run by the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) action found at [.github/workflows/visual-test.yml](.github/workflows/visual-test.yml)

The tests can also be run ad-hoc by running the `npm run test-visual` command. More information are in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) file.

### Accessibility Tests

The project uses [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) to make accessibility tests on pages dedicated to accessibility testing. 

The tests are run by the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) action found at [.github/workflows/a11y-test.yml](.github/workflows/a11y-test.yml)

The tests can also be run ad-hoc by running the `npm run pa11y:test` command.

### Linting

The project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automated code quality/ linting tests.

The tests are run with [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) and are done when staging and committing the code before pushing it to GitHub.

The tests can also be run ad-hoc by running the `npm format:check`, `npm run eslint:check`, `npm run stylelint` commands.

### Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed in the `package.json` file.

### Automatic Versioning

This repository automatically tags new versions. The automatic versioning is done by the [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) action found at [.github/workflows/version-change.yml](.github/workflows/version-change.yml)

For this to happen 4 criteria _must_ be met:

1. The developer must have incremented the `version` string in the [package.json](package.json) upwards
2. There changes are documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file
3. The developer must have run the `npm run build-all` command to make sure the changes to `src/` are reflected in the `dist/` files
4. The changes are merged into the `main` branch

When a pull request that meets these criteria is merged a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions):
1. Creates a new tag with the new version number
2. Tags the new code as `latest`


More details on versioning policy can be found in the [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) file.
