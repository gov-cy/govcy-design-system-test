# govcy-design-system

This is the readme for the `govcy-design-system` code repository. If you are looking for information on using the Design System in a service you should first check the [gov.cy Design System Documentation](https://gov-cy.github.io/govcy-design-system-docs)

The gov.cy Design System is a package containing:
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) files (in `/src`)
  * **The files in `/src` are the only files a developer should manually need to change to update the design system code**
  * SASS files compile into [CSS Stylesheets](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)
  * You can reference CSS in html files to get the look and feel of a gov.cy service

* An already compiled and minified [CSS Stylesheet](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) so you don't have to compile it yourself, located in `/dist`

* Some tools to make adding or changing the CSS easier
  * Development dependencies installed by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and listed in `package.json::devDependencies`
  * A set of commands to compile the [SASS files](https://sass-lang.com/) into a [CSS Stylesheet](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp) in `package.json::scripts`
  * A [simple command line development server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server)
  * A development site where you can see the components and styles that are a result of the css located at `build/index.html` which runs at `http://localhost:3000`

## Updating Documentation

The documentation site lives in a different repository

[govcy-design-system-docs](https://github.com/gov-cy/govcy-design-system-docs
)

It is published on github pages here:

[gov.cy Design System Documentation](https://gov-cy.github.io/govcy-design-system-docs)

## Installation

`govcy-design-system` uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to manage it's dependencies. Therefore [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is a requirement of installing the design system.

You can find information about installing NPM [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

We use `npm>=8.x` to make use of the `package.json::overrides` functionality.

```
git clone https://github.com/gov-cy/govcy-design-system.git
cd govcy-design-system
npm install
```

## Commands

#### npm run css-build

The `css-build` command:

* compiles the sass files in `/src/sass` into a css stylesheet and puts it with the development server files in `/build/css` ready to be served by the development server
* copies the javascript file `/src/js/app.js` from `/src/js` to `/build/js` ready to be served by the development server

#### npm run css-build-distribution

The `css-build-distribution` command:

Compiles the sass files in `/src/sass` into a _minified_ css stylesheet and puts it in `/dist/css` ready to be distributed as a release and included in other peoples websites.


#### npm run start

The `start` command:

Runs a [simple command line development server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) that serves the static files in the `/build` directory on port 3000. This means that when you have run this command you should be able to see your version of the Design System at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The `/build/index.html` file forms the entry point for the design system and shows all the components on a single page so you can see what effect your changes have.

#### npm run css-start / npm run css-watch / npm run watch-css

The watch css commands:

* All do the same thing
* Watch the sass files in `/src/sass` and check for any changes. When it detects changes it re compiles the sass into a css stylesheet into the `/build/css` directory automatically. This means that if you are also running the development server you can just refresh the page to see your changes.

## Tests

### Linting

We have automated code quality/ linting tests that are run using [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint).This library is currently maintained but we haven't found a suitable alternative. Occasionally it causes problems with sub-dependencies/ transitive dependencies that need to be overriden. See the [Dependency Management section of this guidance](#dependency-management) for more information or the `package.json::overrides` section.

The linting is controlled by the configuration file ar [test/config/.sasslintrc](test/config/.sasslintrc). You can read more about how to configure [sass-lint here](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint#configuration-documentation).

The configuration file ([test/config/.sasslintrc](test/config/.sasslintrc)) is provided to the [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint) command line tool by the [package.json::sasslintConfig](package.json) entry.

These are currently run by a simple [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) action found at [.github/workflows/sass-lint.yml](.github/workflows/sass-lint.yml)

### Visual Regression

We have visual regression tests that are required to pass before pull requests are merged. There are a number of components used to make this happen, they are explained below.

#### [Percy](https://percy.io/)

'Percy' is a service/ website that allows you to upload and check visual regression images. It shows a nice diff on the interface that one can apporve or reject. If you send it 2 screenshots it will tell you the difference between them.

#### [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server/)

`http-server` is a lightweight javascript development web server. In our tests it is used to 'serve' our web pages that are screenshotted.

#### [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)

`puppeteer` is a library that provides a browser to visit the served pages and take the screenshots.

#### [percy/puppeteer](https://docs.percy.io/docs/puppeteer)

`percy/puppeteer` is just a customised distribution of the above with some small tweaks to make it work better with Percy.

#### [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/#the-test-directory)

Is a testing framework and command that will find all our tests and run them one by one.

#### [percy/cli](https://github.com/percy/cli)

`percy/cli` is a group of shortcut commands that upload the resulting screenshots to the service/ website.

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed in the `package.json` file.

We use [overrides](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides) to control sub dependencies in the case of a security vunerability found in a sub/ transitive dependency.

## Contributing/ Updating/ Using

Developers should only need to make code changes to the files in the `src/` directory. Updating these files then running the build commands to update the files in `dist/` or `build/` will give you `.css` files that you can use in a web page.

Everything you can do in `CSS` you can do in `SASS` and more. If you are directly editing `.css` files in this repository you have done something wrong.



## Automatic Versioning

This repository automatically tags new versions.

For this to happen 3 criteria _must_ be met:

1. The developer must have incremented the `version` string in the [package.json](package.json) upwards
2. The developer must have run the `npm run build-all` command to make sure the changes to `src/` are reflected in the `dist/` files
3. There must be some change in the `dist/` files




When a pull request that meets these criteria is merged a [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions):
1. Creates a new tag with the new version number
2. Tags the new code as `latest`
